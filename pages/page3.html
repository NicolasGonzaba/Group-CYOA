    <p>The whole room goes silent for a few seconds before suddenly breaking into laughter
        <br>
        "Stop messing around and answer the question."
        <br>
        But when you keep inisting that you really are a vampire the laughter dies down and your friends expressions turn to scowls
        <br>
        "Listen if you're not going to take thsi seriously we might as well not play at all."
        <br>
        Eventually your friends all frustatedly leave after you refuse to back down, looks like you ruined a halloween for your friends.
